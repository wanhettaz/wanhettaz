🎯 **Cloud & Security Engineering Leader | Cybersecurity Transitioner | Tech for Good Enthusiast**

With 15+ years in networking and cloud engineering (specializing in AWS, firewalls, and security architecture), I'm now evolving my career towards cybersecurity—where cloud meets code meets adversary simulation. I bring deep infrastructure knowledge and a strategic eye to securing modern environments, and I'm not here to start at the bottom; I'm here to build the future.
